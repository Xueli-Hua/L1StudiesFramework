**L1OverlapTool** = takes the root output of the L1 rate-estimation tool and makes a plot showing the overlaps between each L1 trigger. Across each row, you see the percentage overlap of every other L1 seed with that row's L1 seed. Works best if you remove any seeds with prescale 0 from the prescale table before running the rate estimation.

**HLTOverlapTool** = calcuates trigger overlaps and PD overlaps for HLT.

**JetEfficiency** = example for how to read in emulated and offline jets and create turn on curves with and without matching to the L1 object.

**RateEstimation** = lists of Ntuples needed for L1 rate estimation studies.

**ReadL1Ntuples** = example for how to read the emulated trigger decisions from L1Ntuples. The menu version must be selected from those listed.

**RunPbPbL1Ntuples2023** = config files and instructions for running the L1Emulator to get the L1Ntuples. Contains cmsDriver and CRAB configs for processing 2023 PbPb data.

**RunPbPbForest2023** = config files and instructions for running L1Emulator and HIForest code simulaneously, in order to get both the L1 and offline information in one root file. Contains cmsRun and CRAB configs for processing 2023 PbPb data.

**RunPbPbL1Ntuples** = config files and instructions for running the L1Emulator to get the L1Ntuples. Contains cmsDriver and CRAB configs for processing 2018 PbPb data, Run 3 PbPb MC, and 2022 PbPb Test Run data.

**RunPbPbForest** = config files and instructions for running L1Emulator and HIForest code simulaneously, in order to get both the L1 and offline information in one root file. Contains cmsRun and CRAB configs for processing 2018 PbPb data, Run 3 PbPb MC, and 2022 PbPb Test Run data.

**RunPPL1Ntuples** = config files and instructions for running the L1Emulator to get the L1Ntuples. Contains cmsDriver and CRAB configs for processing Run 3 PP MC.

**RunPbPbForest** = config files and instructions for running L1Emulator and HIForest code simulaneously, in order to get both the L1 and offline information in one root file. Contains cmsRun and CRAB configs for processing Run 3 PP MC.

**RunPPL1Ntuples2017** = config files and instructions for running the L1Emulator to get the L1Ntuples. Contains cmsDriver and CRAB configs for processing 2017 PP data and 2017 PP MC.

**RunPbPbForest2017** = config files and instructions for running L1Emulator and HIForest code simulaneously, in order to get both the L1 and offline information in one root file. Contains cmsRun and CRAB configs for processing 2017 PP data and 2017 PP MC.
